Basically while merging 2 linkedlists:
1) Declear a PriprotyQueue and use comparator to compare based on value;
PriorityQueue<ListNode> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a.val));
2) Create a dummy List and assign it to current
3) Add heads of all 3 linkedlists to the prioroity Queue
4) While queue is not empty ; pop the lowest one and if there are still elements left offer them popped.next
5) Return dummy.next



Binary Tree Validation: Basically, if a subtree has a height diff >1 then it is not a binary tree.

                5


           /         \
         2            7
        / \            \
      1     4           9
           /          /
          3          6

From 7: Left height = 0 and Right height = 2 (2 edges) so its not a valid binary tree.
