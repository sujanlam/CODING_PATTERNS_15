Basically while merging 2 linkedlists:
1) Declear a PriprotyQueue and use comparator to compare based on value;
PriorityQueue<ListNode> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a.val));
2) Create a dummy List and assign it to current
3) Add heads of all 3 linkedlists to the prioroity Queue
4) While queue is not empty ; pop the lowest one and if there are still elements left offer them popped.next
5) Return dummy.next
